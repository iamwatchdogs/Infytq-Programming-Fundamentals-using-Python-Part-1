# Problem Statement:
#
# We have ‘N’ flavors of toppings that can be added to a coffee. For example  chocolate, hazelnut, vanilla, Irish and so on. 
#
# Write a function that takes the number of available flavors as input and returns the total number of different ways we can have our coffee.
# Note that we can have coffee without any toppings or with different combination of toppings.

    #write your logic here

#Provide different values for number_of_flavours and test your program
